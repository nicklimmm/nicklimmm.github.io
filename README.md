# Welcome nicklimmm's Website Repo!

Link to my website: https://nicklimmm.github.io

This repo serves as a place for me to learn the basics of web development and to create my own personal website (it is still under development). From this project, I learned the basics of HTML and SASS. As of now, the website is created using HTML, SASS, [Bootstrap Icons](https://icons.getbootstrap.com/) and [Animate.css](https://animate.style/). Feel free to give any feedback on my work!
