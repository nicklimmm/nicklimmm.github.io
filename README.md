# Welcome nicklimmm's Website Repo!

This repo serves as a place for me to learn the basics of web development and to create my own personal website (it is still under development). From this project, I learned the basics of HTML and SASS (As of now, the website is created using purely HTML and SASS). Feel free to give any feedback on my work!
